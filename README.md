## Introduction

Ph.D. Student in Human–Computer Interaction (HCI), working at the intersection of neuroengineering and brain–computer interface systems.

My research focuses on medical AI and machine learning for neural signal modeling and BCI applications. I explore data-driven approaches to design adaptive, scalable, and human-centered interactive systems.

With a background in frontend system architecture, I approach AI research from a systems perspective—bridging model development and real-world deployment.
