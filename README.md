## Introduction

Ph.D. Student in Human–Computer Interaction (HCI), 
working at the intersection of neuroengineering and brain–computer interface systems.

My research focuses on medical artificial intelligence, deep learning, and machine learning for neural signal modeling and BCI applications. I explore data-driven approaches to build adaptive, scalable, and human-centered interactive systems.

With a background in frontend system architecture, I approach AI research from a systems perspective—bridging model development, interface engineering, and real-world deployment. I view software as an experimental platform for computational and human-centered inquiry.
